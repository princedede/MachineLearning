## MachineLearning


**Machine learning models**
**DEFINITION**
Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can 
learn from data.
Here is a slightly more general definition:
[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn 
without being explicitly programmed.
—Arthur Samuel, 1959
